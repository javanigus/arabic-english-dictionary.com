					<p><em>The fourteenth letter of the alphabet;</em> called <span class="ar">صَادٌ</span>. It is one of the letters termed <span class="ar">مَهْمُوسَة</span> <span class="add">[or nonvocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only, without the voice]</span>; and of the letters termed <span class="ar">أَسَلِيَّة</span>, as also <span class="ar">ز</span> and <span class="ar">س</span>, because proceeding from the tip of the tongue; <span class="auth">(TA;)</span> and is one of the letters termed <span class="ar">مُسْتَعْلِيَة</span>, which are obstacles to <span class="ar">إِمَالَة</span>: <span class="auth">(M in art. <span class="ar">صود</span>:)</span> it is not conjoined with <span class="ar">س</span>, nor with <span class="ar">ز</span>, <span class="add">[nor, as some say, with <span class="ar">ج</span>, (<a href="#IijBaASN">see <span class="ar">إِجَّاصٌ</span></a>,)]</span> in any Arabic word. <span class="auth">(TA. <span class="add">[<a href="/content/14_S/132_Swd">See also art. <span class="ar">صود</span></a>.]</span>)</span> It is a radical, and a substitute; not an augmentative. <span class="auth">(M in art. <span class="ar">صود</span>.)</span> It is sometimes substituted for <span class="ar">س</span>; and, as MF observes, what Ibn-Umm-Kásim says appears to mean that this substitution is allowable unrestrictedly; but Ibn-Málik, in the Tes-heel, makes it subject to conditions, saying that it is allowable accord. to a certain dial. when the <span class="ar">س</span> is followed by <span class="ar">غ</span> or <span class="ar">خ</span> or <span class="ar">ق</span> or <span class="ar">ط</span>, even when separated therefrom by a letter or by two letters: MF says that the dial. above mentioned is that of Benu-l-'Ambar, accord. to Sb and others; who give as exs. <span class="ar">صَغِبَ</span> for <span class="ar">سَغِبَ</span>, and <span class="ar">صَخِرَ</span> for <span class="ar">سَخِرَ</span>, and <span class="ar">صَقَبٌ</span> for <span class="ar">سَقَبٌ</span>, and <span class="ar">صَطَعَ</span> for <span class="ar">سَطَعَ</span>. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span></p>
