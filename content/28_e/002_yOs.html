<span class="auth">(AZ, Ṣ, Mṣb, TA;)</span> or, as Sb says, accord. to his companions, the verb was originally of two forms, <span class="ar">يَئِسَ</span>, aor. <span class="ar">يَيْئَسُ</span>, and <span class="ar">يَأَسَ</span>, aor. <span class="ar">يَيْئِسُ</span>, and a compound <span class="add">[which is <span class="ar">يَئِسَ</span> having <span class="ar">يَيْئِسُ</span> for its aor.]</span> was then formed from the two;

<span class="auth">(Mbr, Ṣ, TA;)</span> and I’Ab reads, in the Ḳur. xii. 87, <span class="ar">يِيئَسُ</span>, after the manner of the dial. of those who pronounce the first letter of the aor. with kesr excepting such as is with <span class="ar">ى</span> <span class="add">[for its first letter]</span>, <span class="auth">(Ḳ, TA,)</span> which dial, is that of Temeem and Keys and Hudheyl and Asad;

<span class="auth">(Fr, Lb, TA:)</span> and this is done in the instances of <span class="ar">يِيئَسُ</span> and <span class="ar">يِيجَلُ</span> because one <span class="ar">ى</span> is here strengthened by another;
