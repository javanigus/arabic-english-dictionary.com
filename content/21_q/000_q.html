					<p><em>The twenty-first letter of the alphabet:</em> called <span class="ar">قَافٌ</span>. Respecting its pronunciation as the title of the fiftieth chapter of the Ḳur-án, <a href="#SAd">see <span class="ar">صاد</span></a>, <a href="/content/14_S/132_Swd">in art. <span class="ar">صود</span></a>. It is one of the letters termed <span class="ar">مَجْهُورَة</span> <span class="add">[or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the breath only]</span>; its place of utterance is between the root of the tongue and the uvula, in the furthest part of the mouth; and it is of the strongest of the letters, and of the most certain of them in sound. <span class="auth">(TA at the commencement of <span class="ar long">باب القاف</span>.)</span> It is sometimes pronounced like the Pers. <span class="ar">گ</span>, i. e. <span class="ar long">الكَافُ المَمْزُوجَةُ بِالقَافِ</span>; in which case it is termed <span class="ar long">القَافُ المَقْعُودَةُ</span> <span class="add">[?]</span>: this mode of pronouncing it is well known as of the dial. of the people of El-Yemen <span class="add">[and others]</span>: Ibn-Khaldoon says that it is of the dial. of Mudar; and that some of the people of the <span class="add">[Prophet's]</span> house are so extravagant as to assert that recitation in prayer is not rightly but with this letter thus pronounced. <span class="auth">(MF and TA voce <span class="ar">جُلَّنَارٌ</span>.)</span> It has been substituted for one letter, i. e. <span class="ar">ك</span>, <span class="add">[as some say,]</span> in the instance of <span class="ar long">أُكْنَةُ الطَّائِرِ</span> <span class="add">[for which they sometimes said <span class="ar">أُقْنَة</span>]</span>. <span class="auth">(MF and TA at the commencement of <span class="ar long">باب القاف</span>. <span class="add">[It is there added that <a href="#Oukonap">a pl. of <span class="ar">أُكْنَة</span></a> has been heard, but not of <span class="ar">أُقْنَة</span>, and this is a sign of the originality of the former: but <span class="ar">أُقَنَاتٌ</span> is mentioned <a href="#Ouqonap">as pl. of <span class="ar">أُقْنَة</span></a> in art. <span class="ar">اقن</span> in the TA.]</span>)</span></p>
