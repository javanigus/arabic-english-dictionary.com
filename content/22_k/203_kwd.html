It has a noun as the subject, in the nom. case; and an aor., <span class="add">[generally]</span> without <span class="ar">أَنْ</span>, as the predicate. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> Sometimes they introduce <span class="ar">أَنْ</span> after it, likening it to <span class="ar">عَسَى</span>; as, for ex., in the saying of Ru-beh,</p>

					<p><span class="add">[<em>It had nearly come to nought from length of wear</em>]</span>. <span class="auth">(Ṣ.)</span> Used affirmatively, it is affirmative of the being near <span class="add">[to doing a thing, &amp;c.]</span>; and used negatively, it is negative thereof. It is a well-known opinion of many, that, used affirmatively, it is negative; and used negatively, it is affirmative: so that <span class="ar long">كَادَ زَيْدٌ يَفْعَلُ</span> means <span class="add">[<em>Zeyd was near to doing; but</em>]</span> <em>he did not</em> <span class="add">[or <em>did not immediately</em>]</span>; as is shown by the expression <span class="add">[in the Ḳur xvii. 75, where <span class="ar">إِنْ</span> is a contraction of <span class="ar">إِنَّ</span>,]</span> <span class="ar long">وَإِنْ كَادُوا لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ</span> <span class="add">[<em>And verily they were near to seducing thee</em>]</span>: and <span class="ar long">مَا كَادَ يَفْعَلُ</span> means <span class="add">[<em>He was not near to doing; but</em>]</span> <em>he did;</em> as is shown by the expression <span class="add">[in the Ḳur ii. 66,]</span> <span class="ar long">وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ</span> <span class="add">[<em>And they were not near to doing</em> (<em>it</em>); <em>but they afterwards did</em> (<em>it</em>)]</span>. I'Ab is related to have said, that wherever <span class="ar">كَادَ</span> and <span class="ar">أَكَادُ</span> and <span class="ar">يَكَادُ</span> occur in the Ḳur-án, they denote a thing's never happening. Some say, that <span class="ar">كَادَ</span> <span class="add">[with a negative]</span> denotes an action's happening with difficulty. Some, again, say, that the pret. preceded by a negative is affirmative <span class="add">[of the action, &amp;c.]</span>; as is shown by the expression <span class="ar long">وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ</span> <span class="add">[quoted above]</span>: and that the aor. preceded by a negative is negative; as is shown by the expression <span class="add">[in the Ḳur xxiv, 40,]</span> <span class="ar long">لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا</span> <span class="add">[<em>He is not near to seeing it</em>]</span>; meaning that he sees not anything: <span class="add">[though this phrase is said to bear a different meaning, which see below]</span>. But the correct opinion is the one first mentioned; that, used affirmatively, it is affirmative <span class="add">[of the being near to do a thing, &amp;c.]</span>; and used negatively, it is negative <span class="add">[thereof]</span>: so that <span class="ar long">كَادَ يَفْعَلُ</span> signifies <em>He was near to doing; but did not</em> <span class="add">[or <em>did not immediately</em>]</span>: and <span class="ar long">مَا كَادَ يَفْعَلُ</span> <em>He was not near to doing; much less did he do</em> <span class="add">[or <em>do immediately</em>]</span>; the denial of the action <span class="add">[or of the immediate performance of the action]</span> being necessarily understood from the denial of the being near to do it. As to the expression in the Ḳur, <span class="ar long">وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ</span> <span class="add">[quoted above]</span>, it enunciates the state of the people to whom it relates in the beginning of their case; for they were far from sacrificing the cow; and the affirmation of the action is understood only from the <span class="add">[preceding]</span> expression <span class="ar">فَذَبَحُوهَا</span>. And as to the expression <span class="add">[in the Ḳur xvii. 76,]</span> <span class="ar long">لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ</span> <span class="add">[<em>Thou hadst certainly been near to inclining to them</em>]</span>, the Prophet's not inclining to them little or much is understood from <span class="ar">لَوْلَا</span> <span class="add">[preceding]</span>, which requires this inference. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> <span class="add">[Often, however, or <span class="auth">(as some say)</span> generally, with a negative preceding or following it, it is affirmative of the action's happening, but only after difficulty, or delay.]</span> Aboo-Bekr says, that <span class="ar long">مَا كَادَ فُلَانٌ يَقُومُ</span> means <span class="add">[<em>Such a one hardly,</em> or <em>scarcely,</em> or <em>tardily, rose;</em> like <span class="ar long">لَمْ يَكَدْ يَقُومُ</span>, and <span class="ar">كَادَ لَا يَقُومُ</span>; <span class="ar long">وَقَدْ قَامَ</span> being understood; or]</span> <em>he rose after being slow,</em> or <em>tardy:</em> <span class="auth">(L:)</span> and accord. to Az and others, <span class="ar long">مَا كِدْتُ أَفْعَلُ</span> means <span class="add">[<em>I hardly,</em> or <em>scarcely,</em> or <em>tardily, did;</em> or]</span> <em>I did after being slow,</em> or <em>tardy:</em> but sometimes it means <em>I was not near to doing.</em> <span class="auth">(Mṣb, art. <span class="ar">كيد</span>.)</span> It is said, that <span class="ar">كَادَ</span> is sometimes a <span class="add">[mere redundant]</span> connective (<span class="ar">صِلَة</span>) of the members of a sentence; <span class="auth">(Kutr, Akh, AḤát, Ḳ;)</span> as in <span class="ar long">لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا</span> <span class="add">[quoted above]</span>, meaning, <em>He does not see it:</em> <span class="auth">(Ḳ:)</span> or this means <em>he is not near to seeing it:</em> or, as some say, <em>he sees it after his having been not near to seeing it</em> by reason of the intenseness of the darkness: <span class="add">[or <em>he hardly,</em> or <em>scarcely,</em> or <em>tardily, sees it:</em>]</span> and Fr says, with reference to the verse in which this phrase occurs, that it is allowable to say <span class="ar long">لَمْ يَكَدْ يَقُومُ</span> <span class="add">[meaning, <em>He hardly,</em> or <em>scarcely,</em> or <em>tardily, rose</em>]</span> when one has risen after difficulty. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> <span class="add">[Thus it appears, that, <span class="ar long">مَا كَادَ يَفْعَلُ</span> and <span class="ar long">لَمْ يَكَدْ يَفْعَلُ</span> sometimes signify <em>He hardly,</em> or <em>scarcely,</em> or <em>tardily, did:</em> and sometimes, <em>he was not near to doing; he never did; he did not at all:</em> so that it may be rendered <em>he hardly</em> or <em>scarcely,</em> or <em>nowise</em> or <em>in nowise</em> or <em>never, did:</em> or <em>he could hardly do,</em> or <em>he could not at all,</em> or <em>could not nearly,</em> or <em>he could nowise</em> or <em>in nowise, do.</em>]</span></p>
