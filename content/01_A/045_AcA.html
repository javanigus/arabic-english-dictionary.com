Ibn-ʼOsfoor, the second; <span class="auth">(Mughnee;)</span> and so El-Fenjedeehee; <span class="auth">(TA;)</span> and Z, the third; and he asserts that its governing word is a verb understood, derived from <span class="ar">المُفَاجَأَةُ</span>; <span class="add">[agreeably with the explanation cited above from the Ṣ;]</span> but others hold that the word which governs it in the accus. case is the enunciative, which is either expressed, as in <span class="ar long">خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا زَيْدٌ جَالِسٌ</span> <span class="add">[<em>I went forth, and there, in that place,</em> or <em>then, at that time, Zeyd was sitting</em>]</span>, or meant to be understood, as in <span class="ar long">فَإِذَا الأَسَدُ</span>, i. e. <span class="ar">حَاضِرٌ</span> <span class="add">[<em>And there,</em> or <em>then, the lion was present</em>]</span>; or if it be supposed to be <span class="add">[itself]</span> the enunciative, its governing word is <span class="ar">مُسْتَقِرُّ</span> or <span class="ar">اِسْتَقَرَّ</span> <span class="add">[understood]</span>: and in the last of the phrases here mentioned, it may be an enunciative accord. to the opinion of Mbr, the meaning being <span class="ar long">فَبِٱلْحَاضِرَةِ الأَسَدُ</span> <span class="add">[<em>And among the things present was the lion</em>]</span>; but not accord. to the opinion of Zj, because a noun signifying time cannot be the enunciative of one signifying a corporeal thing; nor accord to the opinion of Akh, because a particle cannot be used to denote the enunciative of such a thing; or, as signifying time, it may be the enunciative of such a thing if we suppose a prefixed noun to be suppressed, the meaning of <span class="ar long">فَإِذَا الأَسَدُ</span> being <span class="ar long">فَإِذاَ حُضُورُ الأَسَدِ</span> <span class="add">[<em>And then was the presence of the lion</em>]</span>. <span class="auth">(Mughnee.)</span> You may say either <span class="ar long">خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا زَيْدٌ جَالِسٌ</span> or <span class="ar">جَالِساً</span> <span class="add">[<em>I went forth, and lo,</em> or <em>behold,</em>, &amp;c., <em>Zeyd was sitting</em> or <em>Zeyd</em> was there <em>sitting</em>]</span>, with the nom. as an enunciative and with the accus. as a denotative of state. <span class="auth">(Mughnee.)</span> The Arabs said, <span class="ar long">قَدْ كُنْتُ أَظُنُّ أَنَّ العَقْرَبَ أَشَدُّ لَسْعَةً مِنَ الزُّنْبُورِ فَإِذاَ هُوَ هِى</span> <span class="add">[<em>I used to think that the scorpion was more vehement in stinging than the hornet, and lo, he is</em> <span class="auth">(as vehement as)</span> <em>she</em>]</span>, and also, <span class="ar long">فَإِذاَ هُوَ إِيَّاهَا</span>, which Sb disallowed, in contending with Ks, who allowed it, and appealed for confirmation thereof to certain Arabs, whose judgment was pronounced in his favour; but it is said that they were bribed to give this judgment, or that they knew the place which Ks held in the estimation of Er-Rasheed; and if the latter expression be of established authority, it is irregular and unchaste. <span class="auth">(Mughnee.)</span></p>
