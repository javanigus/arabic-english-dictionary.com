and sometimes indecl. with fet-ḥ: <span class="auth">(Ez-Zejjájee, M, TA:)</span> or, accord. to I Hsh, the termination with fet-ḥ is a rejected form; and that with damm is not mentioned by any of the grammarians: <span class="auth">(TA:)</span> but <span class="ar long">مُذْ أَمْسَ</span> <span class="add">[<em>Since yesterday</em>]</span> occurs, used by poetic licence: <span class="auth">(Sb, Ṣ:)</span> <span class="ar">أَمْس</span> is a noun of which the last letter is made movent to avoid the concurrence of two quiescent letters: and the Arabs differ respecting it: <span class="auth">(Ṣ:)</span> most of them make it indecl., with kesr for its termination, when it is determinate <span class="add">[without the article <span class="ar">ال</span>]</span>: but some of them make it <span class="add">[imperfectly]</span> decl. when it is determinate <span class="add">[in the same manner]</span>: <span class="auth">(Ṣ, Ḳ:*)</span> <span class="add">[accord. to the most approved usage,]</span> you say, <span class="add">[<span class="ar long">رَأَيْتُهُ أَمْسِ</span>, and <span class="ar">بِالأَمْسِ</span>, which is more common, and <span class="ar">الأَمْسَ</span>, <em>I saw him yesterday;</em> and]</span> <span class="ar long">مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْأَمْسِ</span> <span class="add">[<em>I have not seen him since yesterday</em>]</span>;

and the Benoo-Temeem do the same when it is in the accus. or gen. case; but these latter make it <span class="add">[imperfectly]</span> decl. when it is in the nom. case, saying, <span class="ar long">ذَهَبَ أَمْسُ بِمَا فِيهِ</span> <span class="add">[<em>Yesterday has gone with what</em> happened <em>during it</em>]</span>; whereas the people of El-Ḥijáz say, <span class="ar long">ذَهَبَ أَمْسِ بِمَا فِيهِ</span>, because it is <span class="add">[held by them to be]</span> indecl. on account of its implying that it has the determinative article <span class="ar">ال</span> <span class="add">[understood as prefixed to it]</span>, the kesreh being added to avoid the concurrence of two quiescent letters; while the Benoo-Temeem hold it to be, in the nom. case, a deviation from <span class="ar">الإَمْسُ</span>, and therefore imperfectly decl., because of its being determinate, <span class="add">[and so resembling a proper name,]</span> and its deviation from the original form, like <span class="ar">سَحَرُ</span> in the like case: <span class="auth">(IB, TA:)</span> all of the Arabs, however, make it decl. when the article <span class="ar">ال</span> is prefixed to it, <span class="auth">(Ṣ, Ḳ,*)</span> and when it is made indeterminate, or is prefixed to another noun: <span class="auth">(Ṣ:)</span> they say, using it indeterminately, <span class="ar long">كُلُّ غَدٍ صَائِرٌ أَمْسٍا</span> <span class="add">[<em>Every morrow becomes a yesterday</em>]</span>;
