<span class="auth">(Ṣ, Mṣb;)</span> and the rel. n. is <span class="ar">أَوَوِىُّ</span>: <span class="auth">(Ṣ:)</span> but IB says, Sb did not state that the medial radical letter of <span class="ar">آيَةٌ</span> is <span class="ar">و</span>, as J states; but he said that it is originally <span class="ar">أَيَةٌ</span>, and that the quiescent <span class="ar">و</span> is changed into <span class="ar">ا</span>; and he relates of Kh, that he allowed the rel. n. of <span class="ar">آيَةٌ</span> to be<span class="arrow"><span class="ar">آئِىٌّ↓</span></span> and<span class="arrow"><span class="ar">آيِىٌّ↓</span></span> and <span class="ar">آوِىٌّ</span>;
