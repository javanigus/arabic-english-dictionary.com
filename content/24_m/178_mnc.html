<em>the time thereof</em> <span class="auth">(i. e., <span class="ar long">أَمَدُ عَدَمِ رُؤْيَتِى إِيَّاهُ</span> <em>the time of my not seeing him</em>)</span> <em>is a year;</em> meaning, <em>during,</em> or <em>for, a year;</em>]</span> and the noun in this latter case can only be indeterminate; for you cannot say, <span class="ar long">مُذْ سَنَةُ كَذَا</span>: <span class="auth">(Ṣ:)</span> when followed by a noun in the nom. case, as in the instance of <span class="ar long">مُنْذُ يَوْمَانِ</span> <span class="add">[or, accord. to more approved usage, <span class="ar long">مُذْ يَوْمَانِ</span>, as will be shown below, <em>The time is two days,</em> meaning <em>during,</em> or <em>for, two days</em>]</span>, each is an inchoative, and what follows it is an enunciative; and its meaning is <em>the time</em> with respect to what is present, and to a computed period, or a number of days or the like; and <em>the commencement of the space of time</em> with respect to a past time <span class="add">[such as a particular past day or the like]</span>: or each is an adv. n. <span class="add">[of time]</span>, an enunciative, of which what follows is the inchoative, and meaning <span class="ar long">بَيْنَ وَبَيْنَ</span>, as in the instance of <span class="ar long">لَقِيتُهُ مُنْذُ يَوْمَانِ</span>, <span class="add">[or, rather, <span class="ar long">مُذْ يَوْمَانِ</span>,]</span> i. e., <span class="ar long">بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ لِقَائِهِ يَوْمَانِ</span> <span class="add">[<em>Two days have been between the time in which I now am and</em> <span class="auth">(the time of)</span> <em>my meeting him</em>]</span>: <span class="auth">(Ḳ:)</span> but this opinion is rejected by Ibn-Hájib. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> Accord. to some of the Arabs, for they differ on this point, <span class="ar">مذ</span> governs in the gen. case a noun signifying a past time and one signifying a time not past: and accord. to some of them, <span class="ar">منذ</span> governs in the nom. case a noun signifying a past time and one signifying a time not past: <span class="auth">(M, L:)</span> but the general and most approved way is to make <span class="ar">مذ</span> govern in the gen. case a noun signifying a time not past, and in the nom. case one signifying a time past; and to make <span class="ar">منذ</span> govern in the gen. case a noun signifying a time not past and one signifying a time past: <span class="auth">(T, M, L:)</span> most of the Arabs hold, that each must govern in the gen. case a noun signifying the present time; and that it is preferable to make <span class="ar">منذ</span> govern in the same case, and to make <span class="ar">مذ</span> govern in the nom. case, a noun signifying a past time: <span class="auth">(Mughnee:)</span> <span class="add">[they therefore say, <span class="ar long">مُنْذُ اللَّيْلَةِ</span> and <span class="ar long">مُذُ اللَّيْلَةِ</span>, and <span class="ar long">مُنْذُ يَوْمِ الخَمِيسِ</span> and <span class="ar long">مُنْذُ يَوْمَينِ</span>;

<span class="auth">(T, M, L;)</span> as in <span class="ar long">لَمْ أَرَهُ مُنْذُ يَوْمٍ</span>, and <span class="ar long">مُنْذُ اليَوْمِ</span>: <span class="auth">(T, L:)</span> and to pronounce <span class="ar">مذ</span> with the <span class="ar">ذ</span> quiescent when it is followed by a movent letter, <span class="auth">(T, M, L,)</span> and with damm and <span class="add">[sometimes]</span> with kesr when it is followed by a conjunctive <span class="ar">ا</span>; <span class="auth">(M, L;)</span> as in <span class="ar long">لَمْ أَرَهُ مُذْ يَوْمَانِ</span>, and <span class="ar long">لَمْ أَرَهُ مُذُ اليَوْمِ</span>, <span class="add">[and <span class="ar long">مُذِ اليَوْمِ</span>]</span>: <span class="auth">(T, L:)</span> and so say most of the grammarians. <span class="auth">(T.)</span> Lḥ says, The Benoo-ʼObeyd, of the tribe of Ghanee, make the <span class="ar">ذ</span> of <span class="ar">مذ</span> movent when it is followed by a movent or a quiescent letter, and make the noun following it to be in the nom. case, saying <span class="ar long">مُذُ اليَوْمُ</span>; and some of them pronounce it with kesr when followed by a quiescent letter, saying <span class="ar long">مُذِ اليَوْمُ</span>; but this is not the proper way. <span class="auth">(M, L.)</span> In the phrase <span class="ar long">مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذُ اليَوْمِ</span>, the Arabs make the <span class="ar">ذ</span> movent because of the occurrence <span class="add">[otherwise]</span> of two quiescent letters together; and they <span class="add">[generally]</span> give it not kesr, but damm, because the latter is the final vowel of its original <span class="ar">منذ</span>. <span class="auth">(M, L.)</span> One says also, <span class="ar long">مَا لَقِيتُةُ مُنْذَ اليَوْمِ</span>, and <span class="ar long">مُذَ اليَوْمِ</span>, which fet-ḥ to the <span class="ar">ذ</span> in each. <span class="auth">(Ḳ.)</span> The Benoo-Suleym are related to have used the expression <span class="ar long">مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مِنْذُ سِتٌّ</span> <span class="add">[by <span class="ar">ستّ</span> meaning six nights]</span>, with kesr to the <span class="ar">م</span> of <span class="ar">منذ</span>, and with the noun following it in the nom. case: and the tribe of 'Okl are related to have used the expression <span class="ar long">مِذُ يَوْمَانِ</span>, with the <span class="ar">ن</span> elided, and with kesr to the <span class="ar">م</span>, and damm to the <span class="ar">ذ</span>. <span class="auth">(M, L.)</span></p>
