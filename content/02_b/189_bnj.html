And El-Idreesee applies the appellation <span class="ar">حَشِيشِيَّة</span> to the “Assassins.” This establishes the correctness of De Sacy's opinion, that the appellation “Assassins” is derived from the vulgar pl. <span class="ar">حَشَّاشِين</span>, <span class="auth">(hemp-eaters, or persons who intoxicate themselves with hemp,)</span> for <span class="ar">حَشَّاشِين</span> is syn. with <span class="ar">حَشِيشَّة</span>, and the sect called by us the “Assassins” are expressly said by the Arabs to have made frequent use of <span class="ar">بَنْج</span>. Baron Hammer-Purgstall, correctly regarding <span class="ar">بَنْج</span> as hyoscyamus <span class="auth">(or henbane)</span>, makes the following important observations, “‘ Bendj, ’ the pl. of which in Coptic is ‘ nibendj, ’ is without doubt the same plant as the ‘ nepenthe, ’ which has hitherto so much perplexed the commentators of Homer. Helen evidently brought the nepenthe from Egypt, and bendj is there still reputed to possess all the wonderful qualities which Homer attributes to it.” <span class="auth">(Trébutien, “Contes Inédits des Mille et une Nuits,” tome i. p. 12, note.)</span>]</span> The phrase <span class="ar long">شَرِبَ البَنْجَ</span> is used by El-Karkhee <span class="add">[as meaning <em>He drank the</em> <span class="ar">بنج</span>]</span> because it is mixed with water; or <span class="add">[as meaning <em>he took,</em> or <em>swallowed, the</em> <span class="ar">بنج</span>,]</span> according to the conventional language of the physicians. <span class="auth">(Mgh.)</span></p>
