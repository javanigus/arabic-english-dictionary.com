					<p><span class="ar">دُهْدُرَّيْنِ</span> is also a noun, <span class="auth">(Ḳ,)</span> i. e. a verbal noun, <span class="auth">(TA,)</span> signifying <em>He was,</em> or <em>has become, unoccupied,</em> or <em>without work;</em> syn. <span class="ar">بَطَلَ</span>; <span class="auth">(Ḳ;)</span> like <span class="ar">سَرْعَانَ</span> for <span class="ar">سَرُعَ</span>, and <span class="ar">هَيْهَاتِ</span> for <span class="ar">بَعُدَ</span>. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> Hence the prov., <span class="auth">(TA,)</span> <span class="ar long">دُهْدُرَّيْنِ سَعْدُ القَيْنِ</span>, <span class="auth">(Aṣ, Ḳ,)</span> without the conjunction <span class="ar">وَ</span> <span class="add">[after the first word]</span>, and <span class="ar">دهدرّين</span> being written as one word, <span class="auth">(TA,)</span> meaning <em>Saạd the blacksmith became,</em> or <em>has become, unoccupied,</em> or <em>without work;</em> not being employed because of the people's being diverted from other things by drought <span class="auth">(Aṣ, Ḳ)</span> and distress. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> Some say <span class="ar long">سَاعدُ القَيْنِ</span>: and Aboo-ʼObeydeh Maạmar Ibn-El-Muthennà relates it thus: <span class="ar long">دهدرّين سَعْدَ القَيْن</span>, with <span class="ar">سعد</span> in the accus. case, and says that <span class="ar">دهدرّين</span> is governed in the accus. case by a verb understood; apparently meaning that it is a noun signifying <span class="ar">البَاطِلُ</span>, dual of <span class="ar">دُهْدُرٌّ</span>, not a verbal noun, as though the prov. meant <em>Cast ye away what is false,</em> or <em>vain, and Saạd the blacksmith:</em> but what he says is not correct. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> <span class="pb" id="Page_0923"></span>Or a certain blacksmith asserted his name to be Saad for some time, and then his lying became manifest; so this was said to him; meaning, <em>Thou hast added falsehood to falsehood, O Saạd the blacksmith.</em> <span class="auth">(Ḳ.)</span> It is also related separately; <span class="auth">(Ḳ;)</span> and so J and others relate it; saying <span class="ar long">ده درّين</span>: <span class="auth">(TA:)</span> <span class="add">[in one copy of the Ṣ, I find it written <span class="ar long">دُهْ دُرَّيْنْ</span>: in another, <span class="ar long">دُهْ دُرَّيْنِ</span>:]</span> <span class="ar">دُهْ</span> being an imperative from <span class="ar">الدَّهَآءُ</span>; its final radical letter being transposed to the place of the medial, so that it becomes <span class="ar">دُوْهْ</span>, and the <span class="ar">و</span> being then rejected because of the two quiescent letters, <span class="auth">(Ḳ,)</span> so that it becomes <span class="ar">دُهْ</span>, like as is done in the case of <span class="ar">قُلْ</span>: <span class="auth">(TA:)</span> and <span class="ar">دُرَّيْنِ</span> being from <span class="ar">دَرَّ</span>, “it was consecutive;” <span class="auth">(Ḳ;)</span> by the dual form being meant repetition, as in the case of <span class="ar">لَبَّيْكَ</span>, &amp;c.: <span class="auth">(TA:)</span> so that the meaning is <em>Be thou very lying</em> <span class="auth">(Ḳ)</span> <em>and cunning,</em> <span class="auth">(TA,)</span> <em>O Saạd</em> <span class="auth">(Ḳ)</span> <em>the blacksmith:</em> <span class="auth">(TA:)</span> and this explanation, says IB, is good, except inasmuch as that the <span class="ar">د</span> in <span class="ar">درّين</span> thus derived should be with fet-ḥ; or, he adds, it may be with damm to assimilate it to the <span class="ar">د</span> in <span class="ar">دُهْ</span> <span class="add">[like as <span class="ar">القَيْنِ</span> is terminated with kesr to assimilate it to <span class="ar">دُرَّيْنِ</span>]</span>. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> Or the origin of the saying was this: Saạd the blacksmith was a Persian, who went about the districts of El-Yemen, working for the people; and when he became without work in a district, he used to say, in Persian, <span class="ar long">دِهْ بَدْرُودْ</span>: <span class="add">[so in a copy of the Ṣ; and this, or <span class="ar long">دِهْ بِدْرُودْ</span>, is the correct reading: in another copy of the Ṣ, <span class="ar long">دَهْ بَدُورُدْ</span>: and in the copies of the Ḳ, <span class="ar long">دِهْ بَدْرُودْ</span>:]</span> <span class="auth">(Ṣ, Ḳ:*)</span> meaning, <span class="add">[<em>O town, or village,</em>]</span> <em>farewell:</em> to acquaint them that he was going forth on the morrow: <span class="auth">(Ḳ:)</span> or meaning I am going forth to-morrow: <span class="auth">(Ṣ:)</span> in order that he might be employed: and they arabicized the expression, and made him the subject of a prov. with respect to lying; and said, When ye hear of the blacksmith's departure at night, he is assuredly coming in the morning. <span class="auth">(Ṣ, Ḳ.)</span> Some say that the prov. is elliptical, for <span class="ar long">بَطَلَ قَوْلُ سَعْدٍ الخ</span> <span class="add">[<em>False is the saying of Saạd</em>, &amp;c.]</span>. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> <span class="add">[This is mentioned in the Ṣ in art. <span class="ar">در</span>.]</span></p>
