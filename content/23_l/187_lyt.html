					<p>With respect to the proper meaning and etymology of <span class="ar">لات</span> there are four opinions. First, that it is a single word, a verb in the pret. tense: and some say, that it is originally <span class="ar">لَاتَ</span> in the sense of <span class="ar">نَقَصَ</span>, and afterwards used as a negative, like <span class="ar">قَلَّ</span>: so says Aboo-Dharr El-Khushanee, in his Expos. of the Book of Sb: others, that it is originally <span class="ar">لَيِسَ</span>; that its <span class="ar">س</span> is changed into <span class="ar">ت</span>, and then the <span class="ar">ى</span> into <span class="ar">ا</span>, because it is movent and preceded by fet-ḥah: so says Abu-r-Rabeea. Second, that it is two words, the negative <span class="ar">لا</span>, with the fem. <span class="ar">ت</span>, added to make the word fem., as say IHsh and Er-Raḍee, or to render the negation more intensive, as is said in the Expos. of the Katr by the author of the latter work: and this is the general opinion. Third, that it is an independent word, not originally <span class="ar">ليس</span> nor <span class="ar">لا</span>; as related by the sheykh Aboo-Is- hák Esh-Sháṭibee alone. Fourth, that it is a word and a part of a word, namely the negative <span class="ar">لا</span>, and <span class="ar">ت</span> prefixed to <span class="ar">حين</span>; which opinion is ascribed to AʼObeyd <span class="add">[as is mentioned in the Ṣ]</span> and Ibn-El-Taráweh: the former of whom argues in favour of this opinion from the fact that <span class="ar">ت</span> is found so prefixed in Othmán's copy of the Ḳur-án; but this is no proof, because there are found in the writing of that copy things at variance with analogy. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> <span class="ar">تَحِينَ</span> <span class="add">[however]</span> occurs, without <span class="ar">لات</span>, in the following verse of Aboo-Wejzeh:</p>

					<p>With respect to its government there are also four opinions. First, that it has no government: that if a noun in the nom. case follow it, it is put in that case as an inchoative of which <span class="add">[as is mentioned in the Ṣ]</span> the enunciative is suppressed; and that if a noun in the acc. case follow it, it is put in that case as an objective complement of a verb suppressed; which is the opinion of Akh; the meaning of <span class="ar long">لات حين مناص</span> being, in the former case, <span class="ar long">لاحِينُ مَنَاصٍ كَائِنٌ لَهُمْ</span> <span class="add">[<em>A place of flight not existing for them;</em> which does not imply that there was none for others; as <span class="ar">لا</span> here has the force of a particular, not a general, negation]</span>; and in the latter case, the meaning being, <span class="ar long">لَا أَرَى حِينَ مَنَاصٍ</span> <span class="add">[<em>I see not a time of flight</em>]</span>. Second, that it governs in the same manner as <span class="ar">إِنَّ</span>; which is another opinion of Akh and the Koofees. Third, that it is a particle governing the gen. case; an opinion ascribed to Fr by Er-Raḍee and IHsh and others. Fourth, that it governs like <span class="ar">لَيْسَ</span>; and this is the general opinion; but IHsh restricts it by two conditions; that the two nouns which it governs must be significant of time, and that one of them must be suppressed. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> <span class="add">[It is generally the subject, rarely the predicate, that is suppressed.]</span></p>
