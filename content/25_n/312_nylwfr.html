The author of the Irshád and that of the Moojiz also mention, that the beverage prepared from it is an exception from other sweet beverages inasmuch as it does not become converted into yellow bile, which is wonderful; and its oil is more cold and moist than that of violets; and there is no flower more cold and moist than it. Er-Rázee, too, says that the smelling it is one of the causes of weakening the generative faculty, and that the beverage is one of the causes of stopping it; <span class="add">[for which purpose, or as an antiaphrodisiac, it is used in the present day by some of the women of Cairo;]</span> notwithstanding which, it rejoices the heart, and is useful for palpitation of the heart.
