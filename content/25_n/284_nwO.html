Accord. to the T, <span class="ar">نوء</span> signifies the <em>setting</em> of one of the stars, or asterisms, above mentioned: and AḤn says, that it signifies its <em>first setting in the morning, when the stars are about to disappear; which is when the whiteness of dawn diffuses itself.</em> <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> AʼObeyd says, I have not heard <span class="ar">نوء</span> used in the sense of “setting,” “falling,” except in this instance. <span class="auth">(Ṣ.)</span> It is added, <span class="add">[whether on his or another's authority is doubtful,]</span> that the <span class="add">[pagan]</span> Arabs used to attribute the rains and winds and heat and cold to such of the stars, or asterisms, above mentioned as was <em>setting</em> at the time <span class="add">[<em>aurorally</em>]</span>; or, accord. to Aṣ, to that which was <em>rising in its ascendency</em> <span class="add">[<em>aurorally</em>]</span>; and used to say, <span class="ar long">مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا</span> <span class="add">[<em>We have been given rain by such a</em> <span class="ar">نوء</span>]</span>; <span class="auth">(Ṣ;)</span> or they attributed heat <span class="add">[and cold]</span> to the <em>rising</em> or the star or asterism, and rain <span class="add">[and wind]</span>, to its <span class="ar">نَوْء</span> <span class="add">[meaning its <em>setting</em>]</span>. <span class="auth">(AḤn, Ḥar, p. <span class="ar">216</span>.)</span> This the Muslim is forbidden to say, unless he mean thereby, “We have been given rain at the period of such a <span class="ar">نوء</span>;” God having made it usual for rain to come at <span class="add">[certain of]</span> the periods called <span class="ar">انواء</span>. Again, AʼObeyd says, The <span class="ar">انواء</span> are <em>twenty-eight stars,</em> or <em>asterisms;</em> sing. <span class="ar">نوء</span>: the <em>rising</em> of any one of them in the east <span class="add">[<em>aurorally</em>]</span> is called <span class="ar">نوء</span>; and the <em>star,</em> or <em>asterism,</em> itself is hence thus called: but sometimes <span class="ar">نوء</span> signifies the <em>setting.</em> Also, in the L it is said, that each of the abovementioned stars, or asterisms, is called thus because, when that in the west sets, the opposite one rises; and this <em>rising</em> is called <span class="ar">النّوء</span>; but some make <span class="ar">نوء</span> to signify the <em>setting;</em> as if it bore contr. senses. <span class="auth">(TA.)</span> <span class="add">[El-Ḳazweenee mentions certain physical occurrences on the occasions of the <span class="ar">انواء</span> of the Mansions of the Moon; and in each of these cases, except three, the <span class="ar">نوء</span> is the <em>rising,</em> not the setting. Two of the excepted cases are doubtful: the passage relating to the third plainly expresses an event which happens at the period of the <em>auroral setting</em> of <span class="ar">الصَّرْفَة</span>; namely the commencement of the days called <span class="ar long">أَيَّامُ العَجُوزِ</span>; corresponding, accord. to El-Makreezee, with the rising of <span class="ar long">الفَرْغُ المُقَدَّمُ</span>, the <span class="ar">رقيب</span> of <span class="ar">الصرفة</span>: and it is said in the Ṣ, art. <span class="ar">عجز</span>, on the authority of Ibn-Kunáseh, that the <span class="ar long">ايّام العجوز</span> fall at the period of the <span class="ar">نوء</span> of <span class="ar">الصرفة</span>. <span class="auth">(The auroral setting of <span class="ar">الصرفة</span>, at the commencement of the era of the Flight, in central Arabia, happened about the 9th of March O. Ṣ.; and this is the day of the N. Ṣ., the 26th of February O. Ṣ., on which commence the <span class="ar long">ايّام العجوز</span> accord. to the modern Egyptian almanacs.)</span> Hence it appears, that <em>sometimes the setting,</em> but <em>generally the rising,</em> was called the <span class="ar">نوء</span>. Moreover, the ancient Arabs had twenty-eight proverbial sayings <span class="auth">(which are quoted in the Mir-át ez-Zemán, and in the work of El-Ḳazweenee)</span> relating to the <em>risings</em> of the twenty-eight Mansions of the Moon: such as this: <span class="ar long">إِذَا طَلَعَ الشَّرَطَانْ إِسْتَوَى الزَّمَانْ</span> “When Esh-Sharatán rises, the season becomes temperate:” or, perhaps,]</span></p>
